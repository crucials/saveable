# Saveable

:fire: New feature - SoundCloud playlist downloader (_playlists with more than about 100 tracks probably won't be downloaded because app is hosted on 512 MB servers_)

:city_sunset: App contains: 
- Video and audio downloader from such services as Youtube and SoundCloud (_maybe more platfoms soon_).
- Audio extraction from video, converts most of video formats to mp3. And yes, **convertion happens in your browser** so your videos isn't uploaded to anywhere

Website has nice-looking and comfortable design, bottom bar on mobile for faster navigation. There is also dark and light color themes
