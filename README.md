# Saveable

Website with media utilities like video and audio downloader and audio extraction

## Features
:fire: New feature - SoundCloud playlist/album downloader (_playlists with more than about 100 tracks probably won't be downloaded because app is hosted on 512 MB servers_)

:city_sunset: Website has nice-looking and comfortable design, bottom bar on mobile for faster navigation. There is also dark and light color themes

#### Functionallity: 
- Video and audio downloader from such services as Youtube and SoundCloud (_maybe more platfoms soon_).
- Audio extraction from file or Youtube video, converts most of video formats to mp3. And yes, **convertion happens in your browser** so your videos isn't uploaded to anywhere
